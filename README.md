## About Agama-SMS

This repo is home to the Gluu Agama-sms project. This Agama project provides
enhance security using the OTP SMS, reduces the risk of unauthorized access
and fraud, and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements in various
online services and transactions.



## Where To Deploy

The project can be deployed to any IAM server that runs an implementation of
the [Agama Framework](https://docs.jans.io/head/agama/introduction/) like
[Janssen Server](https://jans.io) and [Gluu Flex](https://gluu.org/flex/).


## How To Deploy

Different IAM servers may provide different methods and
user interfaces from where an Agama project can be deployed on that server.
The steps below show how the Agama-SMS project can be deployed on the
[Janssen Server](https://jans.io).

Deployment of an Agama project involves three steps.

- [Downloading the `.gama` package from the project repository](#download-the-project)
- [Adding the `.gama` package to the IAM server](#add-the-project-to-the-server)
- [Configure the project](#configure-the-project)


#### Pre-Requisites
- Third Party Accounts: To utilize the SMS functionality in the Agama-SMS project, you need access to an SMS service provider. A commonly used example is Twilio.


### Download the Project

> [!TIP]
> Skip this step if you use the Janssen Server TUI tool to
> configure this project. The TUI tool enables the download and adding of this
> project directly from the tool, as part of the `community projects` listing.
The project is bundled as 
[.gama package](https://docs.jans.io/head/agama/gama-format/). 
Visit the `Assets` section of the 
[Releases](https://github.com/GluuFederation/agama-sms/releases) to download 
the `.gama` package.


### Add The Project To The Server


The Janssen Server provides multiple ways an Agama project can be 
deployed and configured. Either use the command-line tool, REST API, or a 
TUI (text-based UI). Refer to 
[Agama project configuration page](https://docs.jans.io/head/admin/config-guide/auth-server-config/agama-project-configuration/) in the Janssen Server documentation for more details.



### Configure The Project

The Agama project accepts configuration parameters in the JSON format. Every Agama 
project comes with a basic sample configuration file for reference.

Below is a typical configuration of the Agama-hello project. As shown, it contains
configuration parameters for the [flows contained in it](#flows-in-the-project):

Sample JSON:

```
   {
       "org.gluu.agama.sms.otp": {},
       "org.gluu.agama.sms.register": {},
       "org.gluu.agama.sms.main": {
         "ACCOUNT_SID": "PUT_YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID_HERE",
         "AUTH_TOKEN": "PUT_YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE",
         "FROM_NUMBER": "PUT_YOUR_TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER_HERE"
       }
   }
```

| Flow | Property | Value Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |----------------------- |
| org.gluu.agama.sms.main | ACCOUNT_SID | Your Twilio ACCOUNT_SID (available in your Twilio account settings page)|
| org.gluu.agama.sms.main | AUTH_TOKEN | Your Twilio AUTH_TOKEN (available in your Twilio account settings page)|
| org.gluu.agama.sms.main | FROM_NUMBER | Your Twilio FROM_NUMBER (available in your Twilio account settings page)|

### How it works at a glance

            server->>browser: Redirect to Dashboard
        else Invalid/Expired OTP
            server->>browser: Show "Invalid OTP" Error
        end
    else Invalid Credentials
        server->>browser: Show "Invalid Credentials" Error
    end
```

### Test The Flow

Use any relying party implementation (like [jans-tarp](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/tree/main/demos/jans-tarp)) 
to send an authentication request that triggers the flow.

From the incoming authentication request, the Janssen Server reads the `ACR` 
parameter value to identify which authentication method should be used. 
To invoke the `org.gluu.agama.sms.main` flow contained in the Agama-sms project,
specify the ACR value as `agama_<qualified-name-of-the-top-level-flow>`, 
i.e `agama_org.gluu.agama.sms.main`.



## Customize and Make It Your Own

Fork this repo to start customizing the Agama-SMS project. It is possible to 
customize the user interface provided by the flow to suit your organization's 
branding 
guidelines. Or customize the overall flow behavior. Follow the best
practices and steps listed 
[here](https://docs.jans.io/head/admin/developer/agama/agama-best-practices/#project-reuse-and-customizations) 
to achieve these customizations in the best possible way. 
This project can be reused in other Agama projects to create more complex 
authentication journeys. To reuse trigger the 
[org.gluu.agama.sms.main](#flows-in-the-project) flow from other Agama projects.

To make it easier to visualize and customize the Agama Project, use
[Agama Lab](https://cloud.gluu.org/agama-lab/login).


## Flows In The Project

| Qualified Name| Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| org.gluu.agama.sms.main | This is the main flow; it controls the first factor of the authentication and triggers the second factor.|
| org.gluu.agama.sms.otp | This flow collects an OTP code from the user and performs validation. When validation is done, the result is sent back to the main flow.|
| org.gluu.agama.sms.register| This flow is used to register the user's phone number if the phone number is not setup.|



# Demo

Check out this video to see the **agama-sms** authentication flow in action.
Also check the
[Agama Project Of The Week](https://gluu.org/agama-project-of-the-week/) video
series for a quick demo on this flow.

*Note:*
While the video shows how the flow works overall, it may be dated. Do check the
[Test the Flow](#test-the-flow) section to understand the current
method of passing the ACR parameter when invoking the flow.
